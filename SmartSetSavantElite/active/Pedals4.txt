***************************************************************
*
* above are the assigned actions for 7 possible inputs(left, 
* middle, and right pedals and jacks 1-4). your device will only 
* have some of these inputs (see drawing below). to be used by the
* device, this file must be in plain text format and named 
* "pedals.txt" and it must be located in the active folder on the 
* virtual flash drive(see user?s manual regarding accessing the 
* virtual flash drive).
*
* to change a single key assignement: 
*
* to edit the pedal actions, after the > symbol change the text
* inside the [ ] to a letter, number, or named key or mouse button 
* action. 
*
* example: left pedal does pagedown. see user's manual for list of 
* abbreviations used for other named key actions.
* [lpedal]>[pdown]
*
* when you are done editing, save the file as pedals.txt in plain 
* text format to the active folder. changes are then implemented 
* after moving the slide switch to "play mode" or unplugging 
* and reconnecting the device to a usb port.
*
* if you are using windows and opened this file in notepad, just 
* save it when you are done editing. if it opened in word, use 
* "save as" and select plain text as the "save as type." if you
* are using another word processing program, select "simple text" 
* or "plain text" as the "save as type." 
*
* advanced programming, macros (multiple actions stored on a pedal)
*
* a macro is a sequence of actions. the default jack4 assignment is an 
* example of a macro. all square brackets must be changed to { } 
* (curly braces). make this change first around the pedal or jack 
* name and then around each action to the right of > symbol. each
* character or action requires a "press" using -, followed by a 
* "release" using +. modifier key actions must bracket (surround) the 
* key action which is modified.
*
* then save the file as pedals.txt and activate changes as described above. 
*
* note: on mac osx, modifiers by themselves are not useful to assign to a 
* pedal because one usb device cannot modify another. 
*
* example: macro playing "no" using the right pedal.
* {rpedal}>{-n}{+n}{-o}{+o} 
*
* note: {rpedal}>{-n}{+n}{-o}{+o} also plays no. to produce a shifted key 
* action to produce "no," use "shift" as shown in the next example. 
*
* example: macro playing "no" using the right pedal.
* {rpedal}>{-shift}{-n}{+n}{+shift}{-o}{+o} 
*
* example: macro playing "shift-f1" using the right pedal.
* {rpedal}>{-shift}{-f1}{+f1}{+shift} 
*
* note:  modifiers such as "shift" must surround or bracket the action 
* being modified. see user's manual for more details and examples of 
* using shift and other modifier keys in macros.
* 
* example: macro of double mouse click using left pedal.
* (the default action of jack4). note: this particular macro 
* requires a .125 second delay between actions. 
*
* {lpedal}>{-lmouse}{+lmouse}{125}{-lmouse}{+lmouse}
*
* the locations of pedals and jacks are shown in the diagram 
* below, which depicts the savant elite2 control module and three
* pedals.
