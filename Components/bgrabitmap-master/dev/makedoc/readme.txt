The idea is to add comments with a specific format:
- on the line preceding a declaration
- using { } brackets
- starting with * for a main entry. Example:
{* Specifies the shape of a predefined blur }

- starting with ** for a sub-entry. Example, one enumeration:
{** Gaussian-like, pixel importance decreases progressively }

The sections titles are prefixed and suffixed by ===. Example:
{=== Miscellaneous types ===}
