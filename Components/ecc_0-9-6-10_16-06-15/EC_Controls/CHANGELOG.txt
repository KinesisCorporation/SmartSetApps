TECLink: default cursor changed to crHandPoint

===================
Improved TCustomSpinBtns. Creating bitmaps is moved from constructor to
  CreateWnd. (There were bug: spinbtns were invisible when they were
  created on inactive tab of pagecontrol). Bitmaps are created only

  are loaded from stream with property Visible = False).

2014-11-09 0.9.1.14
===================
Added new visual component TECLink
  It is alternative to TLabel or TStaticText. It can open URL in default

  (Invalid anchors) to console now.

2014-10-02 0.9.1.12

Replaced
inherited Resize;
with
inherited WMSize(Message);
in method TCustomSpinBtns.WMSize(var Message: TLMSize);

2014-09-24 0.9.1.12
===================
TECSpeedBtn: added property Mode, added event OnHoldDown, added entries to docs.
  Formerly: Delay < 0 .. ToggleBox
            Delay = 0 .. SpeedBtn
            Delay > 0 .. DelayBtn
  Now: use property Mode
  Note: Delay has no effect for ebmToggleBox.
        It has effect for ebmDelayBtn (delay before release).
        It has effect for ebmSpeedBtn (delay for OnHoldDown event).

2014-09-24 0.9.1.12
===================
Added new visual component TECBevel
  It allows to create non-rectangular boxes or frames (lowered or raised) and "zigzag" lines (separators).

2014-09-21 0.9.1.12
===================
TECGroupCtrls: Win32 issue - changed default Captions
  cDefCaption+inttostr(ID); instead of cDefCaption+inttostr(Index);

2014-09-20 0.0.1.11
===================
License changet to modified LGPL.

2014-09-19 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECColorCombo: SetItems(); now calls Validate. That's because
  Qt changes automatically ItemIndex from -1 to 0 when Items are assigned.

2014-09-18 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECImageMenu: text of selected item is no painted with clHighlightText
  when Font.Color = clDefault (Description)
  or CaptionFontOptions.FontColor = clDefault (Caption)

TCustomECImageMenu: new items Caption is Item.ID instead of Item.Index
  (method TImageMenuItems.Notify(...); better behavior under Wine)

2014-09-14 0.0.1.11
===================
TCustomECColorCombo: added visual feedback. Focused control is now
  painted highlighted and with focus rectangle around. (Windows)

TCustomECColorCombo: improved behavior in ItemOrder = eioHistory.
  Moving selected item to Index = 0 is moved from Select to EditingDone.

TCustomECColorCombo: Added method SetColorText(string).
(Reason: Setting Tet property must be followed by calling Validate;
  this method performs it itself.)

2014-07-31 0.0.1.11
===================
Improved PositionToHelp properties of TECSlider, TECRuler and TECPositionBar.
(added Forms to uses and modified MouseMove/MouseUp).

Added new visual component TECScheme
Added abstract class TBaseScrollControl to unit ECTypes,
this is based on ideas by Theo:
https://github.com/theo222/lazarus-thumbviewer/blob/master/scrollingcontrol.pas

TECSlider, TECProgressBar and TECPositionBar: removed OnStartDock from published

TECColorCombo: Improved vertical position of items (text).

TCustomSpinBtns code from Resize() moved to WMSize().
(Reason: Better optimalized code. LCL triggers more Resize(); and less WMSize().

TCustomECSpeedBtn is now derived from TGraphicControl (less is sometimes more)
TCustomECSpeedBtn now supports multi-line Caption (and uses composite string editor at design-time)
TCustomECSpeedBtn sets Delay to -1 when Checked is set to True in design time.

2014-05-13 0.0.1.9
==================
TECColorCombo now displays correctly items (closed and dropped-down normal/selected) in Win32/Qt4/GTK2.
(Reason: Canvas.Font.Color and Canvas.Brush.Color wasn't set properly to clWindowText, clHighlightText, clWindow and clHighlight).

Added small abstract class TBaseScrollControl to unit ECTypes. It manages scrollbars only.

Added glyphs egdSizeArrUp, egdSizeArrRight, egdSizeArrDown and egdSizeArrLeft to TGlyphDesign (and implemented in TCanvasHelper class).

Improved calculation of InvalidateRect of TCustomECGrpCtrls when Orientation = eooVertical.

TBaseECSlider (and descendants) are now created with DoubleBuffered = True.
(Reason: some users experienced flickering.)

Methods Resize(); are replaced with message methods WMSize(); (TCustomECSpeedBtn, TCustomECSwitch, TCustomECRuler, TBaseECSlider, TCustomECGrpCtrls).
(Reason: Better optimalized code. LCL triggers more Resize(); and less WMSize();.)

In TCustomECImageMenu.DrawItem() is (odSelected in State) replaced with Focused. It repairs calculation of item-background color in GTK2.
(Reason: (odSelected in State) does not work in GTK2.)

Improved repainting of TCustomECSpeedBtn and TCustomECRuler when these components are resized in GTK2.
(Reason: GTK2 needs extra Invalidate; on resizing, while Qt4 invalidates automatically.)

2014-05-09 0.0.1.7
===================
TCustomECGrpCtrls - controling via keyboard (0 for all up, 1..9 for switch items 0-8) is moved from KeyDown to KeyPress.
(Reason: GTk2 and Qt4 sends different key codes for 0..9, while KeyPress works properly.)

2014-04-25 0.0.1.7
===================
Initial release on Lazarus Mailing List.
